# NWO Talent programme Veni/Vidi/Vici LaTeX template

This is an updated version of the Veni/Vidi/Vici LaTeX template provided by Heerko Groefsema at https://github.com/Heerkog/NWO-Talent-programme-LaTeX-template

The template has been adjusted for the 2022 Vidi call. There are a few modifications:

* The font was changed from `calibri` to `carlito`, a compatible font with a free license, that can more easily be installed
* Some tables and text were updated
* The template was adjusted to have Vidi word lengths etc.

## Using the class

* Install the carlito font
* Compile using XeLaTeX. The bibliography uses Biblatex with Biber backend.
