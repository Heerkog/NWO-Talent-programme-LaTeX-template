# NWO Talent programme Veni/Vidi/Vici LaTeX template

These are a class and template for NWO's Talent programme Veni/Vidi/Vici.
The files use the layout introduced by NWO as of 2020.
The files use the format of the 2021 Veni round for the domains of Applied and Engineering Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, and Science.

## Using the class

To use these files, find and download the Calibri font.
This font is required by NWO and not directly supported by LaTeX.
Place the font files in the root folder that also contains the `NWO_template.tex` file, and rename them as follows: `CalibriRegular.ttf`, `CalibriItalic.ttf`, `CalibriBold.ttf`, and `CalibriBoldItalic.ttf`.
Compile using XeLaTeX. The bibliography uses Biblatex with Biber backend.

## Updates

Since NWO makes changes to its templates regularly, always check whether the files match the latest template.
It is your responsibility to check this. I will not be keeping up with updates of the template by NWO.
